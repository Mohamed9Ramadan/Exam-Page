Project Title:
Interactive Online Exam Portal Using Client-Side Technologies

Project Overview:
This project is an innovative, client-side web application designed to simulate a complete online exam experience. Developed as part of a course on client-side technologies, it brings together modern web design, interactive features, and user-centric design elements. The system guides a user from registration through the test-taking process, to the final display of results, all while maintaining a clean, consistent, and professional look.


Key Features and Functionalities:
- Multi-Step Registration Process:- Registration Pages (First and Second Pages):
Users begin their journey with a minimalistic registration process. The initial pages request basic information—such as first name, last name, and email address—using a sleek dark-themed interface enriched by a world map background. This design not only projects a modern, global feel but also reduces cognitive load by separating user input into successive, bite-sized steps.

- Interactive Exam Interface:- Exam Page:
This core component of the project displays exam questions in a well-organized interface. Key features include:- A dynamic timer that adds a sense of urgency by clearly showing the remaining time.
- A progress bar that visually tracks the exam’s advancement.
- Multiple-choice questions laid out in a clear, distraction-free format.
- Navigation buttons such as "Previous," "Next," "Mark Question," and "Submit Exam" that empower users to navigate and control their exam flow efficiently.
These elements work together to create an environment that not only tests technical knowledge but also respects the practical challenges of time-sensitive test-taking.

- Results and Time Management Pages:- Grade Page:
Once the exam is submitted, the results page provides immediate feedback. It features a clear summary of the user's performance with a congratulatory message and a score display. The design remains uncluttered, ensuring that the feedback is easy to understand and visually accessible.
- Time End Page:
In scenarios where the allotted exam time expires, the "Time's Up" page gently informs the user that the exam session has ended. With a simple message and a prominent “Return to Home” button, this page is designed to provide closure in a supportive and user-friendly manner, ensuring the transition away from the exam is smooth.

Technologies and Tools:
The project leverages the power of client-side technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tools enable:
- Dynamic Content Updates: For live timers and interactive question navigation.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices.
- User-Focused Interactive Elements: Such as form validations, progress indicators, and button feedback that enhance the overall usability of the exam system.
